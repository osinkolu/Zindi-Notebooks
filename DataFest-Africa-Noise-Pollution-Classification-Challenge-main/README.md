# DataFest-Africa-Noise-Pollution-Classification-Challenge
This challenge is hosted on Zindi here: https://zindi.africa/competitions/datafest-africa-2022 for the datafest event.

Due to the widespread noise pollution in our cities, data sponsors Sunbird AI recognised a need to gather data on noise exposure, in order to produce an action plan and empower citizens to be vigilant in tracking and monitoring noise.  The challenge is to train a noise classification model to classify noise into different categories.
