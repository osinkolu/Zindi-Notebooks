# Busara-Mental-Health-Prediction-Challenge-IndabaX-Nigeria
This hackathon was launched on Zindi for as a challenge for the indaba X event. The challenge was to build a machine learning model which accurately predicts which individuals are likely to be depressed from the survey data. It was stated that the model could be used by mental health providers such as local clinics, NGOs or community health volunteers to reach out to those at risk.
