# Gender-Based Violence Tweet Classification Challenge

Can you classify tweets about GBV without using keywords?

The objective of this challenge is create a machine learning algorithm that classifies tweets about GBV into one of five categories: sexual violence, emotional violence, harmful traditional practices, physical violence and economic violence.

Your solutions can be used to summarise tweets and present evidence to policymakers and law enforcement agencies. Along with the classification algorithm, statistics about when and who made the tweet can be used to find trends while preserving anonymity.
