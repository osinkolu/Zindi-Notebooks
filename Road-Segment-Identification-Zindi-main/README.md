# Road-Segment-Identification-Zindi

This solution contains my best notebook for the #zindiweekendz Road Segment Identification Hackathon which I submitted for the active challenge opened as Zindi Knowledge based competition here: https://zindi.africa/competitions/road-segment-identification. 

The objective of this competition is to identify whether an image contains a road segment or not. Dry river beds, railway tracks and power lines could look like roads. It is important to classify these as “not roads”. This will allow government officials to focus on areas they might need to send an official to confirm the road placement, and add it to the government’s maps and road networks. This is a small part of a larger project to fill in missing roads (i.e a more complete roads network), and also make sure that any current road network is properly joined (node to node), making network analysis easier.
