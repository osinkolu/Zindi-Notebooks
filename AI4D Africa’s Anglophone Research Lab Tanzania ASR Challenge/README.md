# AI4D Africaâ€™s Anglophone Research Lab Tanzania ASR Challenge

Voice recognition technologies have the potential to enhance accessibility and improve the human experience of various services. However, a significant obstacle lies in the massive amount of voice data required for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.

Recent years have witnessed remarkable advancements in data collection and ASR methodologies, particularly in the context of under-resourced languages in Africa. These advancements are revolutionizing the field and opening up new possibilities.

The primary objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning ASR model capable of accurately recognizing spoken words in Swahili. By achieving a more precise ASR model for Swahili, we can unlock opportunities for innovative mobile applications and other products and services catered specifically to Swahili speakers.
