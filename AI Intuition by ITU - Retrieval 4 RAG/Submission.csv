These will detail the specific initiatives that the federal government will undertake over time, with clear performance metrics and a commitment to report on results achieved. They will also outline the Government s plan for working with internal and external partners to achieve its vision. The implementation of this Strategy will align with other cyber-related Government of Canada initiatives. These include: the Minister of Democratic Institutions mandate to defend the electoral process from cyber threats; cyber foreign policy in Canada s international agenda; the Canadian military s use of cyber; and the Innovation and Skills Plan. Executive Summary 6 of 35 NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY The Government of Canada s first Cyber Security Strategy allocated $431.5 million over ten years, with three pillars of action and wide-ranging accomplishments: I",". Informed by over 2,000 submissions to our public consultation, the Strategy directly addresses the gaps and areas for improvement in Canada s current cyber security climate. The Strategy s core goals are reflected in Budget 2018 s substantial investments in cyber security totaling more than $500 million dollars over five years. As the largest single investment in cyber security ever made by the Canadian government, Budget 2018 demonstrates our commitment to safety and security in the digital age. THE HONOURABLE RALPH GOODALE Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada iii of iii NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGYAmong the new measures introduced: Funding for the new Canadian Centre for Cyber Security to support leadership and collaboration between different levels of government and international partners, while providing a clear and trusted resource for Canadian citizens and businesses. The creation of the National Cybercrime Coordination Unit to expand the RCMP s capacity to investigate cybercrime, establishing a coordination hub for both domestic and international partners. Funding to foster innovation and economic growth, and the development of Canadian cyber talent. The Strategy is the roadmap for Canada s path forward on cyber security, and is designed to meet the objectives and priorities of Canadians. We are proud to be leading the way. 1 of 35 NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Executive Summary Canada s Place in a Digital World Our world has been transformed by digital innovation. Digital technologies are now an integral part of our daily lives, with new developments emerging every day. From running our businesses, accessing government services, to interacting with our friends and families, these technologies connect Canadians from coast to coast to coast while linking us into a dynamic global network. This is just the beginning. There is endless potential for new and revolutionary ideas",". Responding to calls for decisive federal leadership, the Government of Canada will streamline the way it works and collaborates with external partners and stakeholders by establishing a clear focal point for authoritative advice, guidance, and cyber incident response. This approach will improve information sharing and make it easier for the private sector to obtain the support it needs. The Government of Canada will reinvigorate public awareness and engagement efforts and establish new forums for collaboration. The federal government will work in consultation with a cross-section of Canadian stakeholders to ensure that we collectively enhance cyber security in Canada. The federal government will lead, in partnership with provinces, territories, and the private sector, the development of a national plan to prevent, mitigate and respond to cyber incidents, one that ensures efficient coordination and effective action. Cyber Security Strategy Goals 32 of 35 NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGYThe Government of Canada will work with its international partners to advance Canadian interests. This includes advocating for an open, free, and secure internet and enhancing our international cooperation to combat cybercrime.

Blockchain A blockchain is a write-only database dispersed over a network of interconnected computers that uses cryptography (the computerized encoding and decoding of information) to create a tamperproof public record of transactions",". Together, we will explore initiatives to ensure that Canadian companies can bring their products to a global market. The Government will explore initiatives to drive domestic demand for cyber security technologies and services. The Government of Canada will explore new ideas for making businesses and Canadians of all ages and backgrounds more cyber secure. The federal government has already committed investments to improve digital skills, such as coding education for kids. Working together across governments, academia, and the private sector is necessary to address the cyber skills gap. Taking action now will allow us to build the labour force of the future, one that will help to support Canadian cyber security and that will contribute to Canada s future prosperity. 25 of 35 NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY The quality of information at our disposal shapes our ability to understand cyber trends. The federal government will support Canadian research and statistics efforts to improve our collective understanding of cyber threats and opportunities. Cyber Security Strategy Goals 26 of 35 NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Leadership and Collaboration Strategic Context: Collaborating to Realize the Benefits of Digital Life Advances in technology benefit our communities and our societies. They contribute to our quality of life today, and will be instrumental in meeting the challenges of tomorrow. We all have a responsibility to secure these technologies. Through our National Cyber Security Strategy, the Government of Canada will advance the ways in which we work together to do so. Raising Baseline Cyber Security in Canada The vast majority of Canada s digital systems are owned by individuals and organizations outside of the federal government. From individuals that use few technologies to tech-savvy businesses that are firmly rooted in the online world, many do not realize that they could be the target of cyber threats",". There is no security without privacy. And liberty requires both security and privacy Canadian law enforcement should centralize their cybercrime resources A single window centre will make it easier for businesses to know who to call when their systems have been compromised, and will help law enforcement investigate and respond to cybercrime across jurisdictions About the Cyber Security Review 17 of 35 NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Cyber Security Strategy Goals Secure and Resilient Canadian Systems Through collaborative action with partners and enhanced cyber security capabilities, we will better protect Canadians from cybercrime, respond to evolving threats, and defend critical government and private sector systems. The Government of Canada will maintain and improve cyber security across all federal departments and agencies to protect the privacy of Canadians information held by the federal government and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical services for Canadians. The Government of Canada will enhance law enforcement capacity to respond to cybercrime. It will support coordination across law enforcement agencies and with federal, provincial, territorial, and international partners. The Government will enhance cybercrime investigative capacity and make it easier for Canadians to report cybercrime. Small and medium organizations often lack the knowledge and resources to implement cyber security regimes, even if doing so would offer a competitive advantage. The Government of Canada will help support these organizations making cyber security more accessible. In response to cyber threats of increasing sophistication, the Government of Canada will consider how its advanced cyber capabilities could be applied to defend critical networks in Canada and deter foreign cyber threat actors"
6,What measures is the government of Canada taking in response to data security challenges posed by the emergence of novel technologies?,3,3_Canada_Cybersec_Strategy,". From individuals that use few technologies to tech-savvy businesses that are firmly rooted in the online world, many do not realize that they could be the target of cyber threats. As a result, they do not have measures in place to protect 27 of 35 NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY themselves and recover from cyber incidents. Even those that recognize the importance of securing their information may find it hard to identify affordable and effective measures to protect themselves. The Government of Canada is taking on a leadership role in cyber security to help organizations and Canadians recognize the value of cyber security and to support efforts t o raise the baseline of cyber security in Canada. It will complement these domestic efforts by working with international partners and allies, seeking to reduce the threat to Canada from cybercriminals and also from state actors and their proxies that may seek to harm us. Moreover, the federal government is aiming for national cyber security excellence. Reaching this target will involve enhancing and growing cyber security capabilities in government and industry. It will entail supporting Canada s leading edge research and development, as well as the range of organizations and businesses that do not have strong cyber security measures in place. Private sector leaders will have a central role to play, as a collaborative effort is needed to ensure that all Canadians are as equipped as possible to prevent and respond to cyber threats. Blockchain technology allows for the creation of online ledgers or records. Often associated with virtual curren cies, there are many possible applications of blockchain. It could be used to provide public services like issuing passports, creating records of contracts or legal documents, and processing payments for services rendered",". Individuals, governments, and businesses all want to have confidence in the cyber systems that under pin their daily lives. The Government of Canada envisions a future in which all Canadians play an active role in shaping and sustaining our nation s cyber resilience. Executive Summary 3 of 35 NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY To realize our vision, the Government of Canada and its partners will work together across three themes: Security and Resilience Through collaborative action with partners and enhanced cyber security capabilities, we will better protect Canadians from cybercrime, respond to evolving threats, and defend critical government and private sector systems. Cyber innovation By supporting advanced research, fostering digital innovation, and developing cyber skills and knowledge, the federal government will position Canada as a global leader in cyber security. Leadership and Collaboration The federal government, in close collaboration with provinces, territories, and the private sector, will take a leadership role to advance cyber security in Canada and will, in coordination with allies, work to shape the international cyber security environment in Canada s favour.Executive Summary 4 of 35 NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY In a dynamic cyber security environment, the Government of Canada s approach will be rooted in a sustained commitment to: Protect the safety and security of Canadians and our critical infrastructure Promote and protect rights and freedoms online Encourage cyber security for business, economic growth, and prosperity Collaborate and support coordination across jurisdictions and sectors to strengthen Canada s cyber resilience Proactively adapt to changes in the cyber security landscape and the emergence of new technology Scope of the Strategy The scope of this Strategy starts with the work that the Government of Canada is already undertaking",". This includes ongoing and future efforts to protect Government of Canada systems, to extend our network of partnerships to help protect critical infrastructure, and to help Canadians to be safe online. In a more diverse and dynamic global cyber security landscape, however, Canada s new approach will be more extensive and inclusive. This document outlines the key elements of the global cyber security environment and articulates some of the ways that the Government of Canada will respond to an array of new challenges and opportunities in cyberspace. Executive Summary 5 of 35 NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGYImplementing the Strategy Recognizing that the pace of change we see today will only accelerate, this Strategy is designed as the mainstay of the Government s continuous efforts to enhance cyber security in Canada. The Government s actions will evolve alongside the ground-breaking technological developments and resulting paradigm shifts that have become common in our connected world.

The federal government will work with provinces, territories, and the private sector to help define requirements to protect this digital infrastructure. 19 of 35 NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY Cyber Innovation Strategic Context: Expanding Frontiers of Cyber Security Digital innovation has become the engine of economic growth in the 21st century. Cyber security is not only essential for protecting the sources of Canada s digital innovation it has become a source of innovation in its own right. New Horizons of Technology and Business Development Cyber security is increasingly driving innovation and economic activity in Canada. It already contributes $1.7 billion to Canada s GDP and consists of over 11,000 well-paying jobs. 1 With the global cyber security industry forecasted to grow by 66% by 2021, thousands of additional jobs could 1 International Data Corporation (IDC) Canada , 2016 Canadian ICT Predictions and Forecast: Digital Transformation and Disruption, December 2015 Information and Communications Technology Council (ICTC), Critical Infrastructure in a Hyperconnected Economy, August 2016.CYBER SECURITY SNAPSHOT: SKILLS FOR THE DIGITAL AGE Marc is looking for possible summer camps for his daughters.

The term and definition is inspired by Lessig s modalities of regulation: https://lessig.org/images/resources/1999-Code.pdf 4 Key Digital Functionalities Key Digital Functionalities describe the core (required) functions that this Building Block must be able to perform. The Consent Building Block enables organisations to enforce Data Policies that require signed consent by Individuals for the use of their Personal Data. Its key purpose is to allow individuals to view Consent Agreements and sign or withdraw their consent on what Personal Data is used and accessible to organisations. It also clarifies the Data Policy applied, such as the purpose, retention period, jurisdiction, third-party data sharing, etc. The Consent Building Block implements the key functionalities described in the consent management lifecycle. It includes the ability to configure consent agreements by an organisation admin, present consent requests towards individuals, capture consents, enable queries if consent exists, or not, and enable independent audit of consents. The functionalities are derived from the consent agreement lifecycle and categorised according to the Actors described above. While the consenting workflows (as described above) are implicitly considered the centrepiece of the Consent Building Block, it is important to realise that the integrity of consent management can only be achieved if robust configuration before and auditing after the Consent Agreement signing and Consent Record verification activities are in place. Hence, the functionalities are described following the logical sequence of the consent agreement lifecycle and they are all equally important components of the Consent Building Block. The Consent process (creating and signing Consent Agreements and Consent Records) is initially managed in the application provided by the Organisation that is legally required to collect the consent",". External APIs are described using the OpenAPI 3.x specification. See the following resources for additional information: Definition of the OpenAPI standard Swagger OpenAPI 3.0 Specification 5.7 Building blocks must be deployable as a container (REQUIRED) Each building block MUST be ready to be deployed as independent container images. Source code and build instructions SHOULD be committed to a public code repository where possible. A building block may be composed with Kubernetes or docker compose. All build files must be included alongside the source code. 5.8 Include all deployment scripts (RECOMMENDED) When a building block requires deployment tools such as Kubernetes or Ansible, configuration and deployment scripts should be included in the building block repository. Use of this type of deployment configuration will make individual components of the building block independently scalable and make building blocks less monolithic and more efficient. 5.9 Comply with GDPR Principles (REQUIRED) Building Blocks MUST conform to GDPR principles, including the right to be forgotten account deletion, and privacy requirements to protect the rights of individuals. Note that these requirements may vary by region, and building blocks must conform to regulatory requirements wherever they are deployed. 5.10 Include Support for Capturing Logging information (REQUIRED) Building Blocks MUST have a mechanism for generating logging information. This may be as simple as using STDOUT and capturing through docker logs, or may use other log sinking technologies. 5.11 Use Web Hooks for Callbacks (REQUIRED) When Building Blocks require callback functionality, they must use webhooks and not direct links to functions within the building block. 5.12 Enforce Transport Security (REQUIRED) All Building Blocks MUST support secure HTTPS transport with TLS 1.3 and insecure cyphers disabled. 5"

The Consent process (creating and signing Consent Agreements and Consent Records) is initially managed in the application provided by the Organisation that is legally required to collect the consent. Since it can be either a Data Consuming organisation or a Data Providing organisation, the Consent Building Block allows both to be able to verify their conformance with the underlying Data Policy, both organisations must be able to access and use the application. While the Actors generally fall in line with the categories of the functionalities, it is important to realise that auditing functions in the narrow sense, verifying if data processing is being (or has been) processed according to the Data Policy requiring a consent, is relevant to various entities involved in the data processing. For this reason, the generic verification activity may be executed as part of various workflows satisfying the needs of different actors. Following is the first core set of key functionalities of the Consent Building Block. For potential future developments of the specification follow the work in progress at GovStack confluence page. 4.1 Administrator User Functionalities The Administrator (Data Provider or Data Consumer Admin) configures the Consent Building Block on behalf of the organisation. For simplicity, it is foreseen that one organisation involved in the data processing transaction (that is either Data Provider or Data Consumer) takes the responsibility for the configuration of the Data Policy and respective Consent Agreements(s), and so that the organisation s Administrator maintains the required configurations",". Building blocks should be designed to support multiple locales. 5.28 Use NTP Synchronization (RECOMMENDED) Where precise timestamps are required, building blocks SHOULD leverage Network Time Protocol (NTP) to synchronize timestamps between servers. Other Considerations Software development best practices are recommended for all building blocks. The following guidelines should be followed as part of the software development process. EOL SHOULD be at Least 5 Years No languages, frameworks, or dependencies should be used in a building block where that component has an EOL of less than 5 years. Preference for TIOBE Top 25 Languages See https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/ Where possible, building blocks SHOULD be written using commonly used languages to ensure ongoing maintenance and support are as easy as possible. Building blocks MAY leverage less common languages, such as shell scripting where needed. Regular Security and Code Quality Audits SHOULD be Run These should be run across the code base and dependencies, e.g. https://www.sonarqube.org/ and/or https://snyk.io/ . SHOULD Include Unit and Integration Test Coverage Building blocks should include tests that provide both unit and integration test coverage SHOULD Follow Best Practices for Public Code See https://standard.publiccode.net/ and practices outlined here: Code in the Open Bundle Policy and Source Code Create Reusable and Portable Code Welcome Contributions Maintain Version Control Require Review of Contributions Document Your Objectives Document your code Use plain English Use open standards Use continuous integration Publish with an open license Use a coherent style Pay attention to codebase maturity CONSENT BUILDING BLOCK 2 Description The Consent Building Block enables services for individuals to approve the use of their Personal Data by defining the principles, functions, and architecture of an information system",". The main Administrator actions expected to perform via Consent Building Block are: configuring Data Policies, requesting and signing Consent Agreements with Individuals; viewing (reading, exporting) the Consent Agreements and relevant reports; event-driven (opt-in or opt-out) subscription to (notifications of) changes in Consent Agreements; logging and maintaining an auditable overview of all Personal Data transactions according to Consent Agreements as well as configuration versions. The table below summarises the key use cases identified for an organisation's Administrator. Organisations can be Data Consumers or Data Providers, i.e. the organisations legally delegated the responsibility for collecting consent for the systems handling Personal Data processing. Consent use-cases Link(s) to the UCS CREATE CONSENT AGREEMENT - Here, an organisation Administrator creates a Consent Agreement based on the Data Policy requirements.

Workflow Building Block Manages the workflow and rules associated with requiring or not requiring consent to use Personal Data. Scheduler Building Block Provides an engine for time-based triggers to various events of an automated business process, which might also require consent. Information Mediator Building Block The information mediator Building Block provides a gateway for exchanging data related to consenting workflows; it also provides logs for auditing purposes. 3 Terminology Terminology used within this specification. Term Description Configuration technical implementation of all the content and process conditions as defined by the Data Policy for Consent Agreement creation, reading, updating and deletion, as well as for providing all necessary actors with the required operations Consent Agreement is the agreement to be signed by the Individual and the Data Controller as prescribed by Data Policy, based on which the Data Providing System may transmit the data to the Data Consuming System for the purposes described in the Consent Agreement. Consent Record is created when an individual signs a consent agreement. It represents a signed consent agreement. Consent Reference a unique identifier used to locate and verify the validity of the Consent Agreement. Data Providers is a legal entity that stores and provides access to an Individual's data, which requires the Individual's consent for processing (outside of its primary purpose/location). Data Consumers is a legal entity that requires the Individual's data from the Data Providers according to the consent of the Individual"
9,What are the key findings of the CyberPeace Institute's analysis of cyber threats affecting NGOs in International Geneva?,5,5_CyberPeace_Report,". They have been shared with the NGOs who participated in the project but they have not been requested to endorse them. NGOs concerned by or encountering any of the issues detailed in this report can contact the Institute for advice and support through its CyberPeace Builders program. The CyberPeace Builders1 is composed of regional advisors and experts working and/or volunteering for the CyberPeace Institute, and managing a network of corporate volunteers from local and international companies developed specifically to support NGOs. This program helps NGOs by providing them with pre-incident, post-incident and support services to build their cyber resilience. NGOs can build their resilience by accessing tailored assistance, such as awareness training, dark web monitoring, phishing simulations and website vulnerability scanning. 10 CyberPeace Analytical ReportPart 2 Key Findings Key Finding 1 NGOs in International Geneva are targeted by cyberattacks. 41% of NGOs report having been victim of a cyberattack within the past three years. All NGOs that have experienced attacks report that these were not isolated events. The frequency of these incidents varies, with some NGOs facing incidents on a daily basis and others encountering them on a monthly or annual basis. 70% of NGOs either don t think, or aren't sure whether, they have an adequate level of resilience to recover from a disruptive cyberattack. Key Finding 2 NGOs in International Geneva understand their exposure to cyber risks, but lack the support needed to implement mature cybersecurity strategies. NGOs, unlike entities recognized as critical infrastructure, lack specific designation as a sector for particular protections in cyberspace. Funding for NGOs is generally earmarked for specific projects, often leaving cybersecurity without dedicated financial support",". 14 CyberPeace Analytical ReportNGOs should follow documented best practices for email security, including DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC). Recommendations for the International Geneva While the key findings shed light on the critical challenges that NGOs in International Geneva face in the realm of cybersecurity, the following recommendations provide a concrete roadmap for action. These recommendations are structured according to a cyber capacity building framework developed by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR)2, covering five key pillars: official documents, processes and structures, partnerships and networks, people and skills, and technology. Official Documents Related to Cybersecurity Matters: NGOs should be recognized as stakeholders with specific needs to which host authorities pay particular attention. Given the role of NGOs, promoting their cybersecurity should be integrated strongly into policies. Geneva-based NGOs should develop and implement cybersecurity governance policies and practices, including a cybersecurity policy, an incident response plan, and an asset inventory. The CyberPeace Institute, as a local partner, commits to help them do that. The CyberPeace Institute and its academic partners should enhance their efforts to document, track, and analyze cyberattacks against NGOs within the Geneva ecosystem and any subsequent accountability measures taken, including the prosecution of perpetrators. Processes and Structures: Swiss Public authorities should recognize the specific needs of NGOs. In cases involving ransomware, investigations into the financial flow stemming from extortion schemes should be conducted to hinder the activities of threat actors. Public authorities should actively promote the position discouraging the payment of ransom, emphasizing that it directly finances organized crime and encourages further cyberattacks",". Together, these NGOs bring vital aid and services to tens of millions of beneficiaries. If you are an NGO looking for help with your cybersecurity, we encourage you to reach out to us. We are here to support and protect your vital work in our increasingly digital world. The CyberPeace Institute is an independent and neutral non- governmental organisation (NGO) that strives to reduce the frequency, impact, and scale of cyberattacks, to hold actors accountable for the harm they cause, and to assist vulnerable communities. The Institute is based in Geneva, works in close collaboration with relevant partners to reduce the harm from cyberattacks on people s lives worldwide, and provide assistance. By analysing cyberattacks, it exposes their societal impact, the ways that international laws and norms are being violated, and advances responsible behaviour to enforce cyberpeace. At the heart of the Institute s efforts is the recognition that cyberspace is about people. It supports providers of essential services to the most vulnerable members of society, ultimately benefiting us all. 8 CyberPeace Analytical ReportWhy this Analysis? From Data to Action The aim of this analysis project is to increase understanding of the cyber threat landscape affecting NGOs and aims to provide actionable recommendations. These recommendations address the following areas: 1. How NGOs can better defend and protect themselves from cyberattacks and their associated impact and harm. A separate technical report is also provided to NGOs with more specificities on technical findings from this project. 2. How donors, policymakers, and companies can contribute to safeguarding NGOs in the face of cyber threats. Although the focus of the current report is on Geneva-based organizations, this methodology will be replicated in other contexts and serve as a blueprint for future reports on cyber threats against NGOs",". The sample size of 27 NGOs allowed for a detailed examination of each participating NGO, providing an understanding of their unique contexts, challenges, and practices. This depth of analysis can yield nuanced insights that may be obscured in larger samples. However, the sample size, which constitutes approximately 6% of NGOs in Geneva, 54 CyberPeace Analytical Reportmight not capture the full range of cybersecurity preparedness and threat awareness across the city s NGO community. Additionally, the findings may not be easily extrapolated from the current sample size to other NGOs in different geographical areas, even though general trends can be observed. Limitations This report highlights the range of threats NGOs are facing in International Geneva, but does not aim to serve as a comprehensive guide for the issues discussed. Our analysis did not include questions in relation to the NGOs understanding of the legal and regulatory environment in Switzerland and/or the countries they operate in, which although of importance was not the focus. For example, data protection regulations are key considerations for NGOs managing data which must be respected, with reporting obligations in the event of data breaches. The report purposefully omits detailed information regarding the NGOs that took part in this project. The analysis involved organisations disclosing sensitive information about their vulnerabilities and threat profiles. As such, this precaution is taken to protect the privacy and safety of all the organisations. This report is not exhaustive and acknowledges that there are other threats, vulnerabilities and actors that come into play from those mentioned herein. There is little available analysis focused on the cyber threat and cybersecurity capacities specific to NGOs",". Although the focus of the current report is on Geneva-based organizations, this methodology will be replicated in other contexts and serve as a blueprint for future reports on cyber threats against NGOs.

Overview The organization in this case study is a medium-sized non- governmental organization (NGO) based in Geneva. In September 2019, this organization fell victim to a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) cyberattack. A MitM is a type of cyberattack in which a malicious actor intercepts, with the potential of altering, the communication between two parties without their knowledge or consent. This case study explores the details of the attack, the NGO's response, the impact it had, lessons learned, and recommendations for other NGOs facing similar threats. 2. What happened? In September 2019, shortly after the summer holidays, the NGO's finance department started following up on pending invoices. They noticed that they had not received payment from an overseas Foundation they worked closely with. The finance team followed up with the Foundation, mentioning that the payment had not been made. The Foundation responded to the NGO confirming that they had paid, with proof of payment",". Ransom payments The NCSC recommends that organizations not pay ransom demands, as there is no guarantee the criminal party will uphold their terms and paying ransoms encourages future attacks. For any Swiss organisations faced with a demand for a ransom payment, the NCSC urgently recommends discussing this with the cantonal police.10 38 CyberPeace Analytical Report4. Impact This ransomware attack had several notable impacts on the organization: i. Data recovery: Some data was lost. The organization managed to recover a part of its data, but it required a significant amount of time and effort. ii. Financial impact: The attack disrupted the organization's budget planning and led to unexpected expenses, such as purchasing additional security measures and conducting employee training. iii. Operations: The attack temporarily disrupted the organization's server and one employee's computer, in addition to losing one week's worth of operational information and data. iv. Cybersecurity awareness: The incident highlighted the organization's vulnerability to cyberattacks, prompting them to take cybersecurity more seriously. They made the decision to invest in cybersecurity insurance shortly after this attack. v. Harm: Distress on the employee and his colleagues. 5. Lessons Learned Some of the key lessons learned by this NGO after this incident include: i. Training and awareness: Regular cybersecurity training and awareness programs for employees are essential to protect against future attacks. ii. Data backup and recovery: Ensuring proper data backup and recovery procedures are in place are crucial to safeguard against data loss during an attack. iii. Cybersecurity insurance: Investing in cybersecurity insurance can help mitigate financial losses in the event of a cyberattack. 39 CyberPeace Institute | 2023Case Study #2: Attack on an NGO website 1",".9 of NGOs consider social engineering to be a main threat.78%of NGOs conduct phishing exercies for all staff. 48% 35 CyberPeace Institute | 2023Part 5 Case Studies Case Study #1: Ransomware attack on an NGO 1. Overview An NGO based in Geneva that provides services to other local and international associations faced a ransomware attack in the winter of 2020, which resulted in over a week's worth of operational data being lost. This case study delves into the details of what happened during the attack, the organization's response, the impact on its operations, lessons learned, and recommendations for future cybersecurity preparedness. 2. What happened? In January 2020, a staff member was checking their emails and accidentally opened a PDF file containing malware, leading to the complete encryption of their data, by a threat actor. The perpetrators used a generic email with the PDF in attachment to launch the attack. The NGO does not believe it was specifically targeted by the attackers. The infection initially started on one workstation and subsequently spread to the organization s server. The server stored crucial data, including booking information, financial and accounting data, and personal data of staff members. The attackers demanded a considerable sum of money, in bitcoin, for the decryption of the data. The attack involved a ransomware referred to as REvil (Ransomware Evil). This ransomware was first discovered in April 2019 and has been responsible for numerous high-profile cyberattacks. REvil encrypts files on the victim's computer or network, making them inaccessible, and REVIL ransomware operators demand a ransom payment from their victims in exchange for the decryption key. Malware is a malicious software. These are pieces of code designed to damage, destroy, or subvert computer systems. Malware includes viruses that can replicate and stop systems from working",". Implement continuous website monitoring to detect suspicious activities or traffic anomalies promptly. Set up alerts for security incidents and respond swiftly to any anomalies. Enable Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) for your website to encrypt data in transit, protecting user information and enhancing trust. Establish a clear process for reporting security incidents both internally and, if necessary, to relevant authorities. Consider obtaining cybersecurity insurance to help cover potential financial losses in case of a security breach. Conduct regular security audits and risk assessments to identify and address emerging threats. 42 CyberPeace Analytical Report4. Impact The ramifications of the cyberattack on the organization were wide- reaching and profound. Firstly, the attack had a detrimental impact on the organization's image and credibility, as their website remained unavailable for an entire month. During this period, the organization's stakeholders, including partners and clients, were left with a sense of uncertainty, eroding the trust they had previously enjoyed. Internally, the attack led to significant operational disruptions, with communication channels being severely affected, impacting the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization's day-to-day activities. Furthermore, the attack disabled a contact form which hindered interactions with possible collaborators, potentially and temporarily impeding future partnerships with other NGOs. Lastly, the process of reconstructing the website imposed considerable financial costs on the organization, including expenses for web development, hosting, and security measures. These multifaceted repercussions underscore the critical importance of robust cybersecurity measures and incident preparedness in safeguarding an organization's reputation, operations, and financial stability. 5. Lessons Learned Some of the key lessons learned by this NGO after this incident include: i",". 4. Impact This MitM attack had several significant impacts on the organization: i. Financial Loss: Both the Foundation and the NGO incurred a financial loss due to the fraudulent payment. This was later recovered but the NGO was not expecting the recovery. ii. Operational Disruption: The attack disrupted the NGO s internal operations and caused confusion at the Foundation and the NGO as neither initially understood what had happened. iii. Reputation Damage: The incident had a potentially negative impact on the NGO s reputation, raising concerns amongst management and the board. iv..

Lessons Learned The cyberattack taught the organization several valuable lessons: i. The importance of verifying and cross-checking payment details, especially for invoices involving significant amounts. ii. The need for enhanced staff awareness and training to recognize and respond to phishing attacks. iii. The implementation of rules and processes for handling financial transactions securely. iv. The importance of taking swift action to secure email accounts and applying Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance email security. 48 CyberPeace Analytical ReportAppendices Appendix A: Detailed recommendations Organizational recommendations NGOs should have a specific cybersecurity policy tailored to their organization. A cybersecurity policy outlines how an organization safeguards itself against and responds to cyber threats. It serves as a vital framework that encompasses various aspects of cybersecurity, including systems access control, incident response, inventory procedures, password management and data protection. A cybersecurity policy should involve the senior leadership, as its main goal is to protect the organization s strategic assets"
